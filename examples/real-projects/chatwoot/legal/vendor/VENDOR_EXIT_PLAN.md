#### Data Export Procedures

Dashboard: export transactions, customers, invoices as CSV; API: bulk data retrieval

#### Data Portability

Full transaction history, customer data, and subscription data exportable via API and dashboard

#### Alternative Services

- PayPal/Braintree
- Adyen
- Square
- Paddle
- Lemon Squeezy

#### Contract Termination

Cancel via dashboard; must migrate active subscriptions before closure; 90-day data access post-closure

#### Key Migration Risks

- Active subscription migration complexity
- PCI compliance re-certification with new provider
- Webhook endpoint reconfiguration
- Payment method re-collection from customers

#### Migration Checklist

- [ ] Identify all integration points in codebase
- [ ] Export all data from Stripe
- [ ] Select and evaluate replacement service
- [ ] Implement replacement integration in staging
- [ ] Verify data migration completeness
- [ ] Update environment variables and configuration
- [ ] Test all affected functionality
- [ ] Deploy to production with rollback plan
- [ ] Confirm contract termination with Stripe
- [ ] Verify data deletion from Stripe per DPA requirements
- [ ] Update compliance documentation (privacy policy, sub-processor list)

## General Migration Framework

### Phase 1: Planning (Week 1)

1. **Impact Assessment** — Identify all systems, features, and data flows dependent on the vendor
2. **Alternative Evaluation** — Score alternatives on feature parity, pricing, compliance, and data residency
3. **Stakeholder Communication** — Notify affected teams and set expectations for timeline
4. **Budget Approval** — Secure budget for migration effort and potential parallel running costs

### Phase 2: Preparation (Week 2-3)

1. **Data Export** — Execute full data export from current vendor
2. **Data Validation** — Verify export completeness and integrity
3. **Environment Setup** — Provision accounts and configure new vendor
4. **Code Changes** — Implement abstraction layer or direct replacement in codebase

### Phase 3: Migration (Week 3-4)

1. **Staging Deployment** — Deploy to staging with new vendor integration
2. **Regression Testing** — Run full test suite against new integration
3. **Performance Testing** — Verify latency, throughput, and reliability meet requirements
4. **Data Migration** — Import historical data into new vendor (if applicable)

### Phase 4: Cutover (Week 4+)

1. **Blue-Green Deployment** — Run both vendors in parallel during cutover window
2. **Production Switch** — Point production traffic to new vendor
3. **Monitoring** — Watch for errors, performance degradation, and data inconsistencies
4. **Old Vendor Cleanup** — Terminate contract, request data deletion, revoke API keys

### Phase 5: Post-Migration (Week 5+)

1. **Documentation Update** — Update privacy policy, sub-processor list, vendor contacts
2. **Compliance Review** — Verify new vendor meets all DPA and regulatory requirements
3. **Lessons Learned** — Document migration experience for future reference
4. **Audit Trail** — File migration records for compliance auditing

## Data Deletion Verification

After completing any vendor migration, verify the following:

- [ ] All personal data has been deleted from the old vendor per GDPR Art. 17
- [ ] Vendor has provided written confirmation of data deletion
- [ ] Backup copies at the vendor have been destroyed (confirm retention schedules)
- [ ] API keys and access tokens for the old vendor have been revoked
- [ ] DNS records, webhooks, and integrations pointing to old vendor have been removed

---

## Review Schedule

This vendor exit plan should be reviewed:

- **Annually** as part of the regular vendor management review
- **When adding** a new third-party vendor
- **When a vendor** changes pricing, terms, or has a significant incident
- **Before contract renewal** to evaluate whether migration is advantageous
